============================

The microphone and speaker drivers are released together with a compatible version of Miosix (release 2.02), already configured for the execution of the demo (main.cpp) on STM32F407 discovery board.

Configuration includes:
 - selection of the STM32F407 discovery board
 - disabled DMA for the serial port in miosix/config/arch/cortexM4_stm32f4/stm32f407vg_stm32f4discovery, in order to avoid conflict with I2S in the execution of the demo
